Changed: Added support for prescribing either pressure-only or
full traction vector boundary conditions in AsciiDataBoundary.
Introduced the input parameter "Prescribe pressure instead of
full traction" (default: true) to maintain backward compatibility.
Traction components can now also be specified in spherical coordinates.
This improves flexibility for boundary traction specifications.
