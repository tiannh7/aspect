 Changed: The implementation of visco-elasticity and
 visco-elasto-plasticity has been updated to properly
 track stresses over time. This means that iterative
 advection schemes need to be used, as well as the DG
 method for compositions. For fields, operator splitting
 has to be switched on, while in the case of particles,
 the particle property 'elastic stress' takes care of
 the stress update.
