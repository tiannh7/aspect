# This test checks the viscoelastic_plastic brick extension benchmark,
# but reduces the resolution and viscosity seed for the purpose of runtime
# length. The model runs for five time steps, which reveal that in the first
# three time steps the second nonlinear iteration requires zero linear Stokes
# solves. This likely reflects that elastic stresses buildup prior to yielding
# and the solution does not change significantly during this time.
